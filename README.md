# Parallel-Computing

**Parallelization of the sequential Digital Music Analysis Application using Task Parallel Library(TPL) to achieve high performance and increase runtime speed**

**Project by ARIK INTENAM MIR, for CAB401 - QUT**
- **Codes are in C#**
- **Both sequential and parallel version of the application provided**
- **Report Included**

 **Project Summary**
 
 The application that was chosen for the parallelizing and optimizing runtime speed is called Digital Music Analysis. This is an object -oriented application with interfaces, written using the programming language C#. The application determines the highs and lows of a given audio sample by analyzing the frequencies of the notes, that are being played on the background, and finally displays a frequency visualization of the audio samples along with the octaves of played notes. The sequential application was parallelized using the Task Parallel Library (TPL).
